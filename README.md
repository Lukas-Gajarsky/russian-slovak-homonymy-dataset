# russian-slovak-homonymy-dataset
This repository contains a curated dataset of Russian–Slovak lexical equivalents and interlingual homonyms for linguistic research and embedding-based predictive didactics. The dataset comprises 300 Russian–Slovak lexical pairs, evenly divided into 150 translation equivalents and 150 interlingual homonyms.

The data are provided in CSV format and organized into two files:

equivalents_ru_sk.csv

homonyms_ru_sk.csv

The repository also includes anonymized learner response data from an experimental study based on the lexical dataset. These responses are provided as a binary-coded CSV file (student_response_data_binary.csv) representing learner performance on selected lexical items.
